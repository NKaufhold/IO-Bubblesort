_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This repository is my first try on GitHub as well as my first attempt to code with C++. It was part of a C++ training three months ago.

I have to apologize for every mistake.

This little application takes the input from the console, saves it in an array, sorts the array with a bubblesort algorithm and finally prints the new order as output to the console.
