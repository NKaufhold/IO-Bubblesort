_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This repository is my first try on GitHub as well as my first attempt to code with C++. I have to apologize for every mistake.

My comments are in German. In the future, I'll write them in English.

This little application takes the input from the console, saves it in an array, sorts the array with a bubblesort algorithm and finally gives the new order as output back to the console.
